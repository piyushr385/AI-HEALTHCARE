    <h2>1. Breast Cancer </h2>
    <div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 20px">
       <img src="../static/img/breast.jpg" alt="Breast Image" width="400" height="400">
   </div>
    <p>Breast cancer is cancer that develops in breast cells. Typically, the cancer forms in either the lobules or the ducts of the breast.  Lobules are the glands that produce milk, and ducts are the pathways that bring the milk from the glands to the nipple. Cancer can also occur in the fatty tissue or the fibrous connective tissue within your breast.Cancer occurs when changes called mutations take place in genes that regulate cell growth. The mutations let the cells divide and multiply in an uncontrolled way. <br></p>

    <h3>Symptoms</h3>
    <p>Signs and symptoms of breast cancer may include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A breast lump or thickening that feels different from the surrounding tissue</li>
      <li>Change in the size, shape or appearance of a breast
      </li>
      <li>
        Changes to the skin over the breast, such as dimpling
      </li>
      <li>
        A newly inverted nipple
      </li>
      <li>Peeling, scaling, crusting or flaking of the pigmented area of skin surrounding the nipple (areola) or breast skin</li>
      <li>Redness or pitting of the skin over your breast, like the skin of an orange</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Causes</h3>
    <p>After puberty, a woman’s breast consists of fat, connective tissue, and thousands of lobules. These are tiny glands that produce milk for breastfeeding. Tiny tubes, or ducts, carry the milk toward the nipple.
Cancer causes the cells to multiply uncontrollably. They do not die at the usual point in their life cycle. This excessive cell growth causes cancer because the tumor uses nutrients and energy and deprives the cells around it.
Breast cancer usually starts in the inner lining of milk ducts or the lobules that supply them with milk. From there, it can spread to other parts of the body.
<br>
Researchers have identified hormonal, lifestyle and environmental factors that may increase your risk of breast cancer. But it's not clear why some people who have no risk factors develop cancer, yet other people with risk factors never do. It's likely that breast cancer is caused by a complex interaction of your genetic makeup and your environment.</p>

<h2>2. Diabetes</h2>
<div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 20px">

   </div>
<p>Diabetes is a serious condition that causes higher than normal blood sugar levels. Diabetes occurs when your body cannot make or effectively use its own insulin, a hormone made by special cells in the pancreas called islets (eye-lets). Insulin serves as a “key” to open your cells, to allow the sugar (glucose) from the food you eat to enter. Then, your body uses that glucose for energy. 

But with diabetes, several major things can go wrong to cause diabetes. Type 1 and type 2 diabetes are the most common forms of the disease, but there are also other kinds, such as gestational diabetes, which occurs during pregnancy, as well as other forms.   </p>
<h3>What health problems can people with diabetes develop? </h3>
<p>Over time, high blood glucose leads to problems such as</p>

 <ul>
  <li>heart disease</li>
  <li>stroke</li>
  <li>kidney disease</li>
  <li>eye problems</li>
  <li>dental disease</li>
  <li>nerve damage</li>
  <li>foot problems</li>

<h2>3.Heart Disease</h2>

       <img src="../static/img/heart.png" alt="Heart Image" width="400" height="400">
   </div>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Heart disease describes a range of conditions that affect your heart. Heart and blood vessel disease (also called heart disease) includes numerous problems, many of which are related to a process called atherosclerosis.
Atherosclerosis is a condition that develops when a substance called plaque builds up in the walls of the arteries. This buildup narrows the arteries, making it harder for blood to flow through. If a blood clot forms, it can block the blood flow. This can cause a heart attack or stroke.
A heart attack occurs when the blood flow to a part of the heart is blocked by a blood clot. If this clot cuts off the blood flow completely, the part of the heart muscle supplied by that artery begins to die.</p>

<h3>Symptoms</h3>
 <ul>
  <li>Chest pain, chest tightness, chest pressure and chest discomfort (angina)</li>
  <li>Shortness of breath</li>
  <li>Pain, numbness, weakness or coldness in your legs or arms if the blood vessels in those parts of your body are narrowed</li>
  <li>Pain in the neck, jaw, throat, upper abdomen or back</li>
</ul>

<h2>4.Liver Disease</h2>

   </div>
<p>Liver disease is any disturbance of liver function that causes illness. The liver is responsible for many critical functions within the body and should it become diseased or injured, the loss of those functions can cause significant damage to the body. Liver disease is also referred to as hepatic disease.<br>

Liver disease is a broad term that covers all the potential problems that cause the liver to fail to perform its designated functions. Usually, more than 75% or three quarters of liver tissue needs to be affected before a decrease in function occurs.<br></p>

<h3>Symptoms</h3>
<p>Classic symptoms of liver disease include:</p>
 <ul>
  <li>nausea</li>
  <li>vomiting</li>
  <li>right upper quadrant abdominal pain, and </li>
  <li>jaundice (a yellow discoloration of the skin due to elevated bilirubin concentrations in the bloodstream).</li>
</ul>

<h2>5.Kidney Disease</h2>

        <img src="../static/img/kidney.jpg" alt="Kidney Image" width="400" height="400">
   </div>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Chronic kidney disease, also called chronic kidney failure, describes the gradual loss of kidney function. Your kidneys filter wastes and excess fluids from your blood, which are then excreted in your urine. When chronic kidney disease reaches an advanced stage, dangerous levels of fluid, electrolytes and wastes can build up in your body.<br>

In the early stages of chronic kidney disease, you may have few signs or symptoms. Chronic kidney disease may not become apparent until your kidney function is significantly impaired.

Treatment for chronic kidney disease focuses on slowing the progression of the kidney damage, usually by controlling the underlying cause. Chronic kidney disease can progress to end-stage kidney failure, which is fatal without artificial filtering (dialysis) or a kidney transplant.<br>

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>
Malaria is a mosquito-borne infectious disease that affects humans and other animals. Malaria causes symptoms that typically include fever, tiredness, vomiting, and headaches. In severe cases, it can cause yellow skin, seizures, coma, or death</p><br>
<p>Malaria is caused by single-celled microorganisms of the Plasmodium group.The disease is most commonly spread by an infected female Anopheles mosquito.The mosquito bite introduces the parasites from the mosquito's saliva into a person's blood.The parasites travel to the liver where they mature and reproduce.Five species of Plasmodium can infect and be spread by humans.Most deaths are caused by P. falciparum, whereas P. vivax, P. ovale, and P. malariae generally cause a milder form of malaria.The species P. knowlesi rarely causes disease in humans</p>
<h3>Symptoms</h3>
<ul>
    <li>fever and chills</li>
    <li>impaired consciousness</li>
    <li>prostration, or adopting a prone position
    multiple convulsions</li>
    <li>deep breathing and respiratory distress</li>
    <li>abnormal bleeding and signs of anemia</li>
    <li>clinical jaundice and evidence of vital organ dysfunction</li>

  <p> Pneumonia is a lung infection that can range from mild to so severe that you have to go to the hospital.
It happens when an infection causes the air sacs in your lungs (your doctor will call them alveoli) to fill with fluid or pus. That can make it hard for you to breathe in enough oxygen to reach your bloodstream.
Anyone can get this lung infection. But infants younger than age 2 and people over age 65 are at higher risk. That’s because their immune systems might not be strong enough to fight it.
You can get pneumonia in one or both lungs. You can also have it and not know it. Doctors call this walking pneumonia. Causes include bacteria, viruses, and fungi.  If your pneumonia results from bacteria or a virus, you can spread it to someone else.<p>
  <h3>Symptopms</h3>
 <p> Common symptoms include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>cough</li>
    <li>rusty or green phlegm, or sputum, coughed up from lungs
    fever</li>
    <li>fast breathing and shortness of breath</li>
    <li>shaking chills</li>
    <li>chest pain that usually worsens when taking a deep breath, known as pleuritic pain</li>
    <li>fast heartbeat</li>
    <li>fatigue and weakness</li>
    <li>nausea and vomiting</li>
    <li>diarrhea</li>
    <li>sweating</li>
    <li>headache</li>
    <li>muscle pain</li>
    <li>confusion or delirium, especially in older adults
    dusky or purplish skin color, or cyanosis, from poorly oxygenated blood</li>
